A SFZ drum kit inspired by the music of Michel Jackson

This SFZ drum kit was inspired by the iconic sound of Michel Jackson's *Thriller* album. It was made using a blend of both acoustic and digital drum samples to emulate the energizing backbone of this seminal album.

This drum kit uses 44.1kHz samples, and should work with any SFZ sampler.
